# 💡 Boosting HCP Engagement Through Better Data Health

## 📊 Project Overview

This project was developed as part of my work at **Haleon** to improve the **data quality and completeness of healthcare professional (HCP) records** across the **Middle East & Africa (MEA)** region.  
Accurate HCP data is essential for driving meaningful engagement and supporting brand recommendations — particularly for well-known brands like **Sensodyne**.

To strengthen this foundation, I built an **automated Data Health Dashboard** that evaluates and visualizes the overall quality of HCP data across markets, enabling teams to take targeted corrective actions.

## 🧩 Problem Statement

Driving recommendations from HCPs is at the heart of Haleon’s marketing efforts.  
To achieve this, the company engages HCPs across multiple touchpoints — including **WhatsApp, Email, Haleon Health Portal, remote calls, and webinars** — to encourage product recommendations.

However, a major challenge was that the underlying HCP data was often **incomplete or inaccurate**, leading to:
- Ineffective targeting and communication
- Limited visibility into consent-based outreach opportunities
- Difficulty identifying where corrective actions were most needed

Due to confidentiality, specific datasets and performance metrics cannot be disclosed.

## 🧠 Approach

- Designed and implemented an **automated Data Health Dashboard** combining:
  - **SQL**: for backend data validation, error detection, and integration from multiple data sources.
  - **Power BI**: for interactive and insightful visualization of data health metrics.
- Defined and implemented **data health KPIs**, including error counts, missing fields, and consent-related gaps.
- Enabled market-level and LOC-level drilldowns to identify root causes of data quality issues.
- Integrated automated refresh logic to ensure real-time visibility for stakeholders.

## 📊 Dashboard Capabilities

The dashboard provides:
- A **comprehensive view** of HCP data quality across all MEA markets.  
- **Identification of problematic areas** requiring immediate attention.  
- **Interactive filters** by error types, markets, and LOCs to guide corrective action.  
- **Visibility into communication channels** not being used due to missing HCP consent — helping teams prioritize consent collection for broader outreach.
